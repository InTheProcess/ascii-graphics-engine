# About
Welcome to my Unicode Graphics Engine.  With this engine, you can make games and simulations without a super
demanding graphics engine.  For some of you, this way of drawing on the screen might be part of the style you
are going for.  Regardless to what you plan to create using this engine, I hope it can provide the necessary
functions you desire.  This project is in active development, so improvements are always being made.  For those
of you who find a bug or want a feature, just create an issue about it.  I will read and consiter all suggestions.
You can use/modify/distribute this project to your hearts content as long as you follow the license accordingly.
